# conversion_temperature
I would be happy to help you write a README for your temperature conversion program! Here is a template that incorporates best practices and addresses potential issues:


**Conversion temperature**

This program is a handy tool for converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

**Features:**

User-friendly interface to select conversion mode (Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius).
Accurate conversion calculations using predefined conversion factors.
Option to continue performing multiple conversions without restarting the program.
**To start

Preconditions:
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or higher: https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp (Make sure you have the correct version for your system)
Running the program:
Assuming you have JRE installed, you can compile and run the program by doing the following:
-javac Conversion_Temperature.java # Compiles the Java code
-java Conversion_Temperature # Runs the programUse:

Use:

When the program starts, it will ask you to enter the conversion mode: "Enter your conversion mode: C/F".
Type “C” to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Type “F” to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Enter the temperature value you want to convert.
The program will display the converted temperature and ask if you want to do another conversion ("Do you want to do another conversion? Y/N").
Type “Y” or “o” to continue.
Type any other key to exit the program.

**Additional notes:
**
This program is designed for basic temperature conversions.
For more advanced features, error handling, or a graphical user interface (GUI), you may want to consider further development.
Feel free to customize program messages and conversion factors based on your specific needs.
